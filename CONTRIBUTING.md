#Contributing

Thank you for your interest in KeystoneJS, an open source project administered
by Thinkmill.

Contributing to Keystone is easy. In a few simple steps:

* Ensure that your effort is aligned with the project's roadmap by talking to
the maintainers, especially if you are going to spend a lot of time on it.
* Make something better or fix a bug.
* If you are working on the React Admin UI, run `gulp watch-scripts` to build
the scripts with your changes.
* Make sure you do not add regressions by running `npm test`. There should not
be more errors than you began with.
* Make sure you do not add jshint violations. Run `npm run lint`. There should not
be more violations than you began with.
* Adhere to code style outlined in the .jscsrc file. Run `npm run style`. Ensure
you did not add more style violations than you began with.
* For translation contributions please refer to
[Documentation Translation Guidelines](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/wiki/Documentation-Translation-Guidelines)
* Submit a pull request through Github. _Please do not include build files in
your PR_

If you'd like to talk to the core developers, we all hang out in a Slack channel
to discuss Keystone. Ping @jedwatson to get an invite.
