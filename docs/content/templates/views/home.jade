		h3 Vision
		p Keystone has been built based on patterns and tools that have evolved in the real world,
			| and the core team has used it in several production applications.
		p We have released Keystone under the MIT License to help other developers, and so the project can grow beyond what we're using it for.
		p Feedback and contributions are very welcome. We are currently working on documentation and examples, and have a lot of exciting features to add.
