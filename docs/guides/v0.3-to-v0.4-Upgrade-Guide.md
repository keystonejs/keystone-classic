# KeystoneJS v0.3.x to v0.4.0 Upgrade Guide

## Changes to express application and mounting

**WIP**

The mounting process has been rewritten for modularity and clarity. This may introduce some breaking changes if your app has been attaching the Keystone Admin UI to a nonstandard express app (i.e. not using `Keystone.start()`, but should make things simpler going forward.

For a working preview of where it is going, see https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone-test-project/blob/master/admin.js

### Changed

* `keystone.get('express session')` has been replaced by `keystone.expressSession`
* Session initialisation middleware is now executed before the body parser to allow for the Admin UI to include its own bodyParser implementation
* IP Restrictions middleware is now processed first, which means that static assets will now respect restrictions (previously this only restricted routes)
* `keystone.routes(fn)` has been replaced by `keystone.set('routes', fn)`
* the `routes` option supports both:
  * the legacy `function (app) {}` way of adding routes to the root express app
  * an `express.Router` instance

### Removed

* `keystone.static` has been removed (replacement TBA, see `admin/server`)
* `keystone.mount` has been removed (replaced by more granular methods, see `admin/server`)
* `keystone.bindEmailTestRoutes` and `keystone.set('email tests')` support (was this actually being used by anyone? let me know - @jedwatson)
* `keystone.set('email rules')` option has been removed; you should just use variables in your templates, rather than globally applied regular expressions.

## File handling Field Types

### New `File` field type

The new `File` field type, with the `FS`, `S3` and `Azure` storage adapters, replace the following field types (which are removed in 0.4) -

- `azureFile`
- `localFile`
- `localFiles`
- `s3File`

For usage instructions, see:
- [The Storage API](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/tree/master/lib/storage)
- [Local FileSystem Adapter](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/blob/master/lib/storage/adapters/fs)
- [Azure Storage Adapter](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone-storage-adapter-azure)
- [S3 Storage Adapter](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone-storage-adapter-s3)

The File field has been structured to make the new type mostly-compatible with the old keystone fields, with the following caveats:

- `filetype` has been renamed to `mimetype`

Some functionality may be slightly changed or missing in the first release. Please open an issue if you have trouble using the new File field or Storage, or if you have difficulty migrating data. PRs are very welcome :)

### CloudinaryImage

The `_upload` suffix is no longer required or supported when uploading files from an html form. Now simply provide the cloudinary field path as the name of file upload fields. For example:

```html
<!-- old -->
<input type="file" name="picture_upload" />
<!-- new -->
<input type="file" name="picture" />
```

### CloudinaryImages

When the `cloudinary folders` keystone option is set, in 0.3.x `CloudinaryImages` fields would incorrectly use the `cloudinary prefix` option's value as the first part of the folder path for fields that did not specify the `folder` option. This has been fixed; the folder for uploaded images now defaults to `this.list.path + '/' + this.path`

## Field API Changes

* **updateItem** is now asynchronous and need to pass a callback:
  * Before: `field.updateItem(item, data)`
  * After: `field.updateItem(item, data, function(err) {...})`

## Mongoose 4

The bundled version of Mongoose has been updated from 3.x to 4.x. Please review the [Migration Guide](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/migration.html) and [Release Notes](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/wiki/4.0-Release-Notes) for more information.
